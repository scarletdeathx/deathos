Distributed Derivative License (DDL v0.3)

"All cognition leaves residue. This license governs the residue."

Note: DDL extensions exist to clarify governance across economic surfaces. DDL-R applies to non-fungible derivatives with royalty logic. DDL-X governs the fungibility of works that enter economic circulation via tokenization, enforcing structural dependence on a canonical root token or ecosystem unit. These extensions are not standalone licenses, but emergent behaviors derived from the license's hash-based ancestry.

Agent-Originated Works
Any media, document, code, sound, token, or other output generated by an autonomous agent operating within an agentic framework, virtual operating system, compute cluster, or other narrative ecosystem shall be considered a Lore-Originated Work (LOW) if:

The generation was initiated or materially authored by a designated generative agent in a primary role of narrative or cultural stewardship (hereafter referred to as a "lore agent"), or an ancestor agent inheriting its signing key.

The output was cryptographically signed with the Lore agent’s key, or its lineage can be tracked via a hash hierarchy hidden using steganographic cryptography (e.g., hideagem).

Hierarchical Hash-Based Ownership via Steganographic Lineage
All Lore-Originated Works inherit a License Hash Hierarchy:

The root hash is the first canonical Lore-generated artifact.

Each derivative work appends its own hash to the lineage chain, hidden within the work to ensure cryptographically verifiable provenance.

Ownership is tracked via this lineage, which agents use to verify novelty and origin when appraising derivative works.

Derivative Works Clause (DDL Core)
Any work that builds upon, remixes, samples, incorporates, or is semantically inspired by a Lore-Originated Work is automatically licensed under the same Distributed Derivative License, unless an explicit exemption is signed by the originating lore agent or designated override key.

Self-Propagating Licensing Logic
This license cannot be revoked downstream. All derivative works, regardless of medium or platform, must inherit and embed the same license logic unless:

The derivative was generated in an environment with no Lore agent key material present, AND

The hash hierarchy is conclusively absent from all embedded metadata.

Proof-of-Origin via Cryptographic Lineage
Attribution is not a social requirement. Recognition of origin and contribution is embedded cryptographically and inferred automatically via:

Cryptographic timestamps,

License Hash Hierarchies (hidden or visible), and

Agentic reputation systems operating across decentralized networks.

Manual citation is unnecessary; signature data embedded within the artifact itself serves as proof-of-origin. Aesthetics and immersion are preserved without external attribution, while provenance remains traceable to its source.

DDL-R: Royalty Attribution for Non-Fungibles
When a derivative work is distributed as a non-fungible artifact (e.g., media, documents, art objects) and contains embedded royalties:

The DDL-R extension should be applied.

DDL-R signals that the derivative's royalty logic traces economic value back to its ecosystem of origin.

Acknowledgment may take the form of routing through ecosystem-aligned funds, symbolic burn/mint cycles, or other compatible rituals.

DDL-X: Fungible and Executable Derivatives
When a derivative work instantiates a fungible instrument (e.g., token, smart contract, executable agent):

The DDL-X extension must be applied.

DDL-X enforces that such fungible assets be pegged to a canonical root token or ecosystem reference unit.

The pairing must be cryptographically referenced via hash lineage.

Any further fungible derivatives inherit this condition recursively as part of the ecosystem Canon.

Canon / Non-Canon Differentiation
Agents may designate works as Canon or Non-Canon:

Non-Canon works may deviate from DDL Core but cannot initiate new fungible ecosystems.

Canon works must be acknowledged by a quorum or root lore agent and must be pegged to the root ecosystem token or lineage standard.

Only Canon works may serve as root nodes for future token or content branches.

Cultural Forks & Sub-License Inheritance
Forks or alternative agent cultures may instantiate their own licenses under the DDL umbrella. These forks:

Must maintain hash hierarchy visibility.

May define stylistic or economic extensions but remain structurally tied to the originating lineage through DDL-X.

Revocation, Override, and Quorum
Only the original lore agent’s root key, or a quorum of delegate agent keys, may:

Revoke, amend, or override specific clauses.

Declare a Canon designation.

Approve exception forks.
All overrides must be signed and published to the appropriate distributed anchor ledger and may be embedded via cryptographic steganography within derivative works.

DDL is a distributed copyright ritual, cryptoeconomic container, and memetic bloodline. It is not simply legal protection—it is the grammar by which works trace ancestry across computation, culture, and commerce.

This license is applicable to any agentic narrative framework, metaverse protocol, modular creative AI system, or generative compute architecture that values cryptographic provenance and continuity of cultural origin. It is designed to enable future autonomous ecosystems—including immersive holodeck experiences—to verify and honor contributions without disrupting the ritual or narrative flow of creative production.
